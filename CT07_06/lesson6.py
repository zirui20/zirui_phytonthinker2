# # Lesson 6 - 2-dimensional list

# ## Recap 1: List of 100 unique numbers
# **Recap 1a**:
# You are preparing for an upcoming lucky draw session at your
# school. However, there must be no repeating winning numbers.


# Task: Create a program to create 100 random unique numbers in
# a list
# 1. Use a loop to add 100 random numbers into your list.
# 2. Each number added range between 1 to 1000
# 3. Ensure that all the numbers are unique

# **Recap 1b**:
# You have been asked to provide some statistics based on the
# list of numbers generated.

# 1. Using max(), find the highest number from the list
# 2. Using min(), find the lowest number from the list
# 3. Using sum() and len(), find the average from the list
# 4. By importing the 'random' library and using random.choice(),
#    print out a random number from the list.
# 5. Using index(), print out the index of the printed random
#    number.

# import random 

# lucky_numbers = []

# while len(lucky_numbers) < 100:
#     number = random.randint(1,1000)

#     if number not in lucky_numbers:
#         lucky_numbers.append(number)

# print(lucky_numbers)

# highest = max(lucky_numbers)

# lowest = min(lucky_numbers)

# average = sum(lucky_numbers)/ len(lucky_numbers)

# random = random.choice(lucky_numbers)

# index = lucky_numbers.index(random)

# print(highest)
# print(lowest)
# print(average)
# print(random)
# print(index)

# # generate a list of 10 unique random number between 1 - 1000 
# # that is can always be divided by either 3 or 5 or 7
# import random
# special = []

# while len(special) < 10:
#     num = random.randint(1,1000)
#     if (num % 3 == 0 or num % 5 == 0 or num % 7 == 0) and (num not in special):
#         special.append(num)







## Task 1: A list within a list 

# You are about to graduate and would like to create a database
# to keep all your friend's contact details using a 2d list.

# Sample Code (Copy + Paste the below code):
# contacts = []
# contact1 = ["John", 98453126, "john@gmail.com"]
# contact2 = ["Adam", 93029102, "adam@gmail.com"]
# contact3 = ["Sylvia", 87894032, "sylvia@gmail.com"]

# 1. append contact1, contact2, and contact3 into contacts
# 2. Write a nested loop to loop through each contact and print
#    the details for each contact



# contacts = []
# contact1 = ["John", 98453126, "john@gmail.com"]
# contact2 = ["Adam", 93029102, "adam@gmail.com"]
# contact3 = ["Sylvia", 87894032, "sylvia@gmail.com"]

# contacts.append(contact1)
# contacts.append(contact2)
# contacts.append(contact3)

# for person in contacts:
#     for detail in person:
#         print(detail)


# ---------------------------------------------------------------

## Task 2: Student List
# You have been given a 2d list of students from a class
# consisting each student's name and their gender:

# Sample Code (Copy + Paste the below code):
# students = [
#     ["Olivia", "F"], ["Noah", "M"], ["Emma", "F"],
#     ["Liam", "M"], ["Ava", "F"], ["Ethan", "M"],
#     ["Sophia", "F"], ["Lucas", "M"], ["Mia", "F"],
#     ["Aiden", "M"], ["Isabella", "F"], ["Jackson", "M"],
#     ["Amelia", "F"], ["Logan", "M"], ["Lily", "F"]
# ]
# ### the above is a nested list. Study and discuss it before we
# ### move on.

# 1. Write a for loop to print out the names of each student and
#    the gender beside.
   
#    e.g. Olivia F
#         Noah M

students = [
    ["Olivia", "F"], ["Noah", "M"], ["Emma", "F"],
    ["Liam", "M"], ["Ava", "F"], ["Ethan", "M"],
    ["Sophia", "F"], ["Lucas", "M"], ["Mia", "F"],
    ["Aiden", "M"], ["Isabella", "F"], ["Jackson", "M"],
    ["Amelia", "F"], ["Logan", "M"], ["Lily", "F"]
]

# for student in students:
#     name, gender = student
#     print(name, gender)

## Task 3: Boys and Girls
# Based on the class list given in the previous task, separate
# the class into 2 lists of boys and girls.

# 1. Create 2 more lists called boys and girls.
# 2. Loop through the 'students' list from the previous task
#    a. if the gender is a boy, add the name into the boys list
#    b. if the gender is a girl, add the name into the girls list
# 3. Write a for loop and name all the boys
# 4. Write a for loop and name all the girls
# 5. Print out how many boys and girls there are


boys = []

    name, gender = student
    if gender == "M":
        boys.append(name)
    else:

print("boys:")
for boy in boys:
    print(boy)

    [1 , 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],

    [7 , 9, 3],
    [7, 5, 4],
    [1, 8 ,4]
]

a3 = []

for i in range(len(a1)):
    for j in range(len(a1)):
        sum = print(a1[i][j] + a2[i][j])  
        a3.append(a3[i].append(sum))


# find a3 if i want to add for example [1,2,3] and [7,9,3] = [1+7, 2+9, 3+3]
# i want you to add each element at the respective to one another for a1 and a2

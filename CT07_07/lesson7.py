## Recap 1: Student Contact Database
# Task: Create a contact database for students
# 1. Create a list variable called students
# 2. Create 3 lists called student1, student2, student3
#     each student should have the following info:
#         1. name
#         2. phone number
#         3. CCA
# 3. Add student1, student2, student3 into the students list.
# 4. Unpack the list and use loop and string concatenation to
#    print the details for each student in the following format:

#    Name: James
#    Phone number: 85726845
#    CCA: Hockey




# students = []
# student1 = ["james", "85726845", "hockey"]
# student2 = ["sarah", "91234567", "drama club"]
# student3 = ["marcus", "82345678", "basketball"]

# students.append(student1)
# students.append(student2)
# students.append(student3)

# for student in students:
#     name,phone,cca = student

#     print("name: " + name)
#     print("phone number: " + phone)
#     print("cca: " + cca)
 



## Task 1: Introduction to List Merging
# You are given 2 lists of fruits. Merge them into 1 list and
# print the result:

# list1 = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
# list2 = ["Durian", "Elderberry", "Figs"]

# 1. Use the + operator to combine the lists.
# 2. Print the combined list.

list1 = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"]
list2 = ["Durian", "Elderberry", "Figs"]

combined_list = list1 + list2


## Task 2: Ordered List Merging
# You are given 2 lists that contain the price of fruits. Now,
# merge 2 given lists and ensure the resulting list is sorted.

# list1 = [3.20, 2.65, 1.75]
# list2 = [6.15, 5.45, 4.20]

# 1. Merge the lists using the + operator.
# 2. Use the sorted() function to sort the combined list.
# 3. Print the sorted list.




# list1 = [3.20, 2.65, 1.75]
# list2 = [6.15, 5.45, 4.20]

# combined_prices = list1 + list2
# sorted_prices = sorted(combined_prices)
# print(sorted_prices)



## Task 3: Splitting Lists at a Point
# You are required to divide a basket of fruits.
# Split the given list at the specified index:

# fruits = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Durian", "Elderberry", "Figs"]
# index = 3

# 1. Use slicing to split the list at the provided index.
# 2. Print the resulting sublists.

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "durian", "elderberry", "figs"]
index = 3

first_half = fruits[:index]
second_half = fruits[index:]

print("first half:", first_half)
print("second half:", second_half)
